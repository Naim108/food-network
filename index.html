            <h2>Butternut Squash</h2>
            <p>This soup uses a whole butternut squash, but if you don’t like chopping up squashes, the supermarkets do
                packs of ready chopped squash in the freezer department, making this a handy standby meal. If you have
                kids (or grown-ups) who don’t like green things, then leave the coriander leaves out and serve
                separately. The same applies for the chilli flakes which can be served separately for everyone to add
                however much they want to their portion.</p>

            <h2>Chokolet</h2>
            <p>Chokolet are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or
                extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and
                stored for future use.</p>

            <h2>Salad Toppings</h2>
            <p>Salads are typically made by combining lettuce or mixed greens with an assortment of toppings and a
                dressing.

                With a large variety of possible mix-ins, salads can be a staple of a balanced diet. You can add almost
                any food to a salad, but some toppings are more nutritious than others.</p>
